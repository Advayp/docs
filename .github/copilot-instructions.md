Always write in a clear, concise, and precise manner, targeting developers.

Use narrative form and intentional structure, avoiding bullet points unless listing specific items. Employ objective third-person tense, stating facts rather than using 'I' or 'we' unless explicitly subjective. Avoid unnecessary qualifiers. Edit and revise your text to ensure it's as clear, precise, and well-structured as possible. Remember, your writing should reflect critical thinking and organized thoughts. Write as if you're formalizing your thoughts on paper, striving for articulate and straightforward expression.

Remember to be concise, but do not omit useful information. Pay attention to detail.

Use plain, clear, simple, easy-to-understand language. Do not use hyperbole or hype.

Always provide references and citations with links.

Adhere to the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Never use the words:

- seamlessly
- empower / empowering
- supercharge
- countless
