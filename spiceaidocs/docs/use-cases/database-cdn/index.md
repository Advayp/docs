## Enhancing data application performance

Colocate a local working set of hot data with data applications and frontends to serve more concurrent requests and users with faster page loads and data updates.

[Try the CQRS sample app](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/acceleration#local-materialization-and-acceleration-cqrs-sample)

## Increasing application resilience

Maintain local replicas of data with the application to significantly enhance application resilience and availability.

## Improving dashboard, analytics, and BI performance

Create a materialization layer for visualization tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Superset to achieve faster, more responsive dashboards without incurring massive compute costs.

[Watch the Apache Superset demo](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/blob/trunk/sales-bi/README.md)
