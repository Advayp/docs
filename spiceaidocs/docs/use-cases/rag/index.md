Use Spice to access data across various data sources for Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG).

Spice enables developers to combine structured data via SQL queries and unstructured data through built-in vector similarity search. This combined data can then be fed to large language models (LLMs) through a native AI gateway, enhancing the models' ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.
